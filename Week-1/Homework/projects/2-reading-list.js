/**

The Reading List
Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

=====
Exercise 1
=====
Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for:

- The title (a string)
- Author (a string)
- and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you read it yet)

Loop through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: 

"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien"

=====
Exercise 2
=====
Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. 

If you read it, log a string like 'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien', and if not, log a string like 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'

let books = [
{
     title: "The Hobbit",
     Author: "J.R.R Tolkien",
     alreadyRead: true
},
{
    title: "The Lord of Rings",
    Author: "J.R.R Tolkien",
    alreadyRead: false
}

];

//   function getTitleAuthor (books){
//       return books.title+" by "+books.Author;
//   }
books.forEach(function getTitleAuthor(books) {
    if(books.alreadyRead){
        console.log("You already read "+ books.title + " by " + books.Author);
    }
    else {
        console.log("You still need to read "+books.title + " by " + books.Author);
    }
});
